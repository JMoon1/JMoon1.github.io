My name is Jamie Moon. My interests include biology, data science and programming in R.


### Background
Currently I have been working at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a Post-Bac Research Associate for a proteomics data science group.

I obtained a B.A. in Biology from San Francisco State University. It was there, that I discovered my love for bioinformatics and programming.
